# Pokedex

Guided project from https://www.boot.dev/ to learn Typescript.
Pokedex is a command-line REPL (Read–eval–print loop) that uses the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) to build a make-believe device that lets us look up information about Pokemon.

## Learning Goals
* Practice making HTTP requests in TypeScript
* Learn how to build a CLI tool that makes interacting with a back-end server easier
* Get hands-on practice with local Typescript development and tooling
* Learn about caching and how to use it to improve performance
